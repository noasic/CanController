# CAN 2.0A/B Controller IP Core

## Overview

The noasic CAN Controller is a professionally developed IP core implemenenting both medium access (MAC) and physical layer
functions of the CAN bus protocol such as data encapsulation/decapsulation, frame coding
(stuffing/destuffing), medium access management, error detection, error signaling,
acknowledgment, serialization/deserialization, bit encoding/decoding, bit timing and synchronization.

## Features

* Implements the CAN protocol version 2.0A/B, ISO-11898-1
* Supports standard (11-bit) and extended (29-bit) identifiers
* Configurable data rate up to 1 Mbit/s
* Configurable timing parameters:
  - Prescaler factor (1..256)
  - Bit sampling time
* Built-in error handling & fault confinement
  - Receive and transmit error counters
  - Error active, error passive and bus-off states
  - Interrupt request lines for bit error, stuff error, CRC error, form error, ACK error, arbitration loss and overload frame reception
* Parallel Tx and Rx message interface with simple valid/ready handshake
* Test modes
  - Listen-only mode
  - Loopback mode for self-testing purposes

## Licensing

The CAN Controller IP Core is provided under the terms of the Apache License Version 2.0. Please [contact us](mailto:info@noasic.com) if you require a commercial license or additional consulting services for your project.

## Limitations

* The controller does not generate overload frames on its own, but responds to overload flags on the bus
* The controller does not perform automatic bit-rate detection. Bit-rate detection, if needed, must be performed in software using the controller's listen-only mode.
* No built-in sleep mode/wake up functionality
* No automatic re-start after bus-off (core must be reset)
* No support for message abortion

## Core Usage

### Bit Timing Configuration

In accordance with the CAN standard, the nominal bit time is divided four separate, nonoverlapping time segments:

* The synchronization segment is used to synchronize the various nodes on the bus. An edge is expected to lie within this segment. The length of `SYNC_SEG` is fixed to 1
TQ.
* The propagation segment is used to compensate for the physical delay times within the network. The length of `PROP_SEG` is 1..8 TQs.
* The phase segments 1 and 2 are used to compensate for edge phase errors. These segments can be lengthened or shortened by resynchronization. The length of `PHASE_SEG1` and `PHASE_SEG2` is 1..8 TQs.

![Segments](doc/segments.png)

The sample point is the point in time at which the bus level is read and interpreted as the
value of that respective bit.

Within the CAN Controller Core, the bit timing can be set using the `TSEG1` and `TSEG2` parameters. The nominal bit time, is given by the following expression:

```
nominal bit time (in TQs) = 1 + TSEG1 + TSEG2
```

The length of a time quanta, in system clock cycles, is set using the `PRESCALER` configuration value:

```
TQ length (in system clock cycles) = 1 + PRESCALER
```

**Note**: for any given CAN bit rate, several bit-time settings can be used. You can use a CAN bit
timing calculator such as http://www.bittiming.can-wiki.info to find the optimal settings for
your application.

### Message Transmission

To transmit a message, the user must apply valid message contents on the `i_tx_msg` port
and assert the `i_tx_msg_valid` port. Both signals must remain constant until the message
transmission is acknowledged by the core using the `o_tx_msg_ready port`.

### Message Reception

The reception of a message is signalled by the `o_rx_msg_valid` port going high for one clock
cycle. It is the responsibility of the user to register the received message upon assertion of
the `o_rx_msg_valid` signal.

## Core Architecture

The CAN Controller Core consists of a number of sub-modules:
* The **Prescaler** divides the system clock by a programmable factor to match the adapt for the bus data rate
* The **Bit Timing Logic** (BTL) handles the transmission and reception of single bits on the bus
* The **Bit Stream Processor** (BSP) implements the medium access controller (MAC) tasks such as data encapsulation/decapsulation, arbitration, error detection, retry on
lost arbitration. It also manages the error state of the controller (error-active, errorpassive, bus-off) as well as the error counters and generates the interrupt signals.
